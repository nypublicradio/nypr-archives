/*
This mySQL query 
run in cavafy
generates a list of instantiation IDs 
and their formats, 
alongside their location 
and cavafy URL

You can export it as csv (careful with the delimiters!)
or as xml and play with it 
as the start of a physical-item manifest.

This search generates a list of Listening Room reels.
To do your own search, change the line 

      WHERE title LIKE 'Listening Room%'

to whatever series you want to search, for example

      WHERE title LIKE 'On the Line'. 

Also, change the line

      format_id = 83

(which corresponds to 1/4 inch audio tape)

to the proper value, e.g. 

83 	FormatPhysical    1/4 inch audio tape
89 	FormatPhysical 	CD-Audio
92 	FormatPhysical 	DAT
100 	FormatPhysical 	Lacquer disc
103 	FormatPhysical 	DBX 700 VHS tape
107 	FormatPhysical 	Minidisc
425 	FormatPhysical 	Audio cassette
427 	FormatDigital 	BWF
438 	FormatPhysical 	Beta PCM F-1
