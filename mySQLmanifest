/*
This mySQL query 
run in cavafy
generates a table that is close to
the 'Core' schema on BWF MetaEdit,
as well as a couple of additional fields.

You can export it as csv (careful with the delimiters!)
or as xml and play with it 
as the start of a physical-item manifest.

This search generates a list of Listening Room reels.
To do your own search, change the line 

      WHERE title LIKE 'Listening Room%'

to whatever series you want to search, for example

      WHERE title LIKE 'On the Line'. 

Also, change the line

      format_id = 83

to the proper value, e.g. 
83 	FormatPhysical    1/4 inch audio tape
89 	FormatPhysical 	CD-Audio
92 	FormatPhysical 	DAT
100 	FormatPhysical 	Lacquer disc
103 	FormatPhysical 	DBX 700 VHS tape
107 	FormatPhysical 	Minidisc
425 	FormatPhysical 	Audio cassette
427 	FormatDigital 	BWF
438 	FormatPhysical 	Beta PCM F-1
